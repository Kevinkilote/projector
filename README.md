This is one of my projects from university. In this project, our aim is to implement advanced image synthesis technology
by integrating the output of two projectors at different angles to display a large, seamless and continuous image on a flat screen.
Various computer graphics techniques, such as alpha blending and gamma correction, are used to seamlessly blend the two projected images.

To run the code, execute the MaskCreator.py and ConfigReader.py. The main display of the two blended images will appear by running the MainDisplay.py code.
The result should be as the result.jpg, from our project we managed to create the Linear_test.jpg. Any suggestions for improvement is welcome.
